### 🧑‍🏫 Problem Definition
When you need the file name of the copied code (e.g., when writing a technical blog), it aims to overcome the inconvenience of pasting the copied code and having to type the file name manually.

<br />

### 🧪 Requirements 
**Essential Requirements**

- [ ] When selecting a block of code to copy, insert the file name as a comment at the very top of the code block and automatically copy it to the clipboard
- [ ] Distribute as a VS Code extension and an npm package
- [ ] Document HOW TO USE, CONTRIBUTION, etc.


**Additional Requirements** 
- [ ] Ability to customize the path of the file name inserted into the copied code block
- [ ] Flexibility to change the format of the copied code block (wrap with backticks, fix indentation)
- [ ] Further additions to be discussed later
